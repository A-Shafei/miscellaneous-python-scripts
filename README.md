Small messy python scripts

I'm not even sure I know what all of these do. 

They're from the days before I knew GIT or.. the value of documentation.

Made them either as part of coursework for online courses or because I needed a script to do something in a jiffy.

Would not have uploaded them hadn't the Instabug application asked for a GitHub account. Scavenged for old files or files I got clearance to upload.
